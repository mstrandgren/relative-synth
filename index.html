			<h2>Browser based Samchillian Synth</h2>

			<p>At <a href="https://nordicjs.com/">Nordic.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nexxy">Emily Rose</a> demoed her <a href="https://github.com/nexxy/cerulean">node.js implementation</a>
			of a <a href="http://www.samchillian.com/">Samchillian</a>, an instrument based on relative pitch, played on a qwerty keyboard.
			I tried to play, but it was incredibly hard. So I thought I'd make an app to make it easier to learn.</p>

			<p>I haven't gotten very far yet, and odds are I won't have time to, but you can play, and there's some visual aid to
			let you know where you are and how to get where you're going. At least if you're at all familiar with a piano.</p>

			<p>NOTE: It probably only works on Chrome on a Mac(Book*). Keyboards and keycodes differ, and I didn't have time to make it generic.
